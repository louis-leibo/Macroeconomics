Analysis of long-run Economics Development in Brazil and Japan

This project is part of a Macroeconomics course, taken at the London School of Economics (LSE) in 2022/2023. It consists of describing and explaining long-run economic growth in Japan and Brazil between 1950 and 2019, using data from the Penn World Table (June 2021 version).  

To explain long-run economic growth in these two countries, the data set was used to compute: 
- A trend time path for real GDP at constant 2017 national prices
- A measure for TFP
- The contribution of each input variable to measures changed in GDP

Main findings (from the Abstract of the Final Paper): 
"Findings reveal that both economies exhibited strong economic growth before 1975 that declined thereafter. Besides diminishing factor returns, Brazil’s slowdown is attributed to the 1970s oil crises and Japan’s to the burst of the 1991 asset bubble and an ageing population. The paper takes a pessimistic view on Japan’s long-term growth outlook and a mixed view on Brazil’s."
